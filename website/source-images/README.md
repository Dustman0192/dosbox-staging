This folder contains editable sources files for the illustrations in the
guide.

Do this if you want to change any of the illustrations:

- change the source file first
- re-export/regenerate the PNG from it
- check in the updated source file
- check in the updated PNG file

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is recommended for editing SVG files.

Use the [dirtree](https://github.com/johnnovak/dirtree) tool to generate PNGs
from the [directory tree](dirtree) descriptions.
